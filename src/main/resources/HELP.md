### Searching

Search for given text (operator contains) in:
- request title
- request description
- task title
- task description
- issues
- comments


**Remark 1:** currently only list of requests (containing searched string) is returned as result  
**Remark 2:** when using styling in description text, search may not work as expected because 
there are html tags inserted in the text.


### Search by label

Syntax: `<LABEL>: text`


Examples:
- `TAG: network` - search all tags containing word network
- `GROUP: new functionality` - search by group
- `ASSIGNEE: John` - search by assignee (case sensitive!)
